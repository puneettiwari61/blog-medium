> Elixir is great for writing highly parallel, reliable applications

#### I have recently started learning elixir, and I am already in love with it.

As a Javascript developer, I have much more familiarity with Object-Oriented Programming(oop) than the functional programming paradigm though javascript does have some functional elements.

In the words of **José Valim** Creator of **Elixir.**

_Elixir is a pragmatic approach to functional programming. It values its functional foundations and it focuses on developer productivity. Concurrency is the backbone of Elixir software. As garbage collection once freed developers from the shackles of memory management, Elixir is here to free you from antiquated concurrency mechanisms and bring you joy when writing concurrent code._

> “Most programmers treat threads and processes as a necessary evil; Elixir developers feel they are an important simplification.”

**A functional programming language** lets us think in terms of functions that transform data. This transformation never mutates data. Instead, each application of a function potentially creates a new, fresh version of the data. This greatly reduces the need for data-synchronization mechanisms.

Concept of OOP was really a need when CPUs weren’t that fast and memory was a very limited resource. It was a rudimentary requirement to save as much as memory we can save and mutate it as necessary.

It’s really interesting how changes in hardware affect how we write software. Today, a similar phenomenon is happening. Our CPUs are not getting any faster. Instead, our computers get more and more cores. This means new software needs to use as many cores as it can if it is to maximize its use of the machine. This conflicts directly with how we currently write software.

We can’t deny the upcoming boom of functional programming and personally I think Elixir is outrunning every programming language. I am going to deep dive in elixir, stay tuned, I will be sharing my learnings at every stage.
